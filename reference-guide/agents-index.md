## Quick Reference Guide

### Common Agent Patterns

1. **Search & Retrieval**
   - Most knowledge agents support search with keywords
   - Repository agents allow searching by file names, content, or metadata
   - System Search Agent provides file system-wide search capabilities

2. **Creation & Management**
   - Note-taking agents allow creating, updating, and organizing notes
   - Repository agents support creating repos, branches, files, issues
   - Media tools enable project creation and asset management

3. **Control & Automation**
   - Home Assistant allows controlling smart devices
   - OBS controls streaming and recording
   - Puppeteer enables web automation

4. **Analysis & Insight**
   - Prometheus provides system metrics analysis
   - RAGFlow enables document-grounded question answering
   - Reaper QA analyzes music production projects

### Combinations for Advanced Workflows

- **Content Research & Note-Taking**: Use Fetch Agent to retrieve web content, then create notes with TriliumNext or Outline
- **Development Documentation**: Use Gitea Agent with BookStack or Outline to maintain code and documentation in sync
- **Media Content Creation**: Combine YouTube transcription with OBS recording and Reaper production
- **Smart Home Monitoring**: Use Home Assistant with Prometheus to monitor and control home environment

### Troubleshooting Quick Reference

1. For permission or access issues: Check credentials and configured paths
2. For search with no results: Try broader terms or different search parameters
3. For creation failures: Verify all required parameters are provided
4. For control operations: Ensure the target exists and is accessible
5. For complex workflows: Break down into multiple simpler steps
